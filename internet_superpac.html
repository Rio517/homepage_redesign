# Big money has broken American democracy, and it's taking the Internet down with it.

A vast movement of Internet-connected citizens fought hard to defeat SOPA and PIPA. These bills would have crippled the Internet and left an environment hostile to innovation and free information. The people, united, won a battle.

But Congress remains undeterred, and continues to try and get the worst parts of these bills passed.  These bills favor the interests of big money over the interests of the people.  Our government has been captured by the big money interests.  These interests are inimical to democracy.

*They will keep coming.*

*They will not stop.*  

***Unless we fight back.***

# It’s not hard to identify the root cause of this error

Our government no longer represents us. Congress is meant to be dependent ‘on the people alone,’ but politicians are instead dependent upon big money from a small group of rich and powerful political donors &mdash; about 150,000 people &mdash; to get elected. 

It’s now estimated that members of Congress spend 30 to 70 percent of their workday courting these donors.  If a politician wants to keep getting elected, the most important thing for them to do is keep the funders of campaigns happy.  And what makes them happy is not necessarily good for us.  As researchers at Princeton have shown, the average citizen has no influence on government. None.

We, the People, are fighting back: We are the Mayday PAC

We started as a small group of dedicated volunteers led by Harvard law professor and anti-corruption activist Larry Lessig.  In May, we launched the Mayday PAC, a citizen-crowdfunded, kickstarted Super PAC to end all Super PACs. We set a seemingly impossible goal: to raise $1 Million from small donors in one month.  But with the help of the people, we met the goal in just two weeks.  Then we got the $1 Million matched by a group of donors who, unlike most political donors, would like to level the playing field, even if it means seeing their influence decreased.

This month, our goal is to raise $5 Million by July 4th and declare independence from a broken system.  And then get that amount matched. With $12 million total in hand, MAYDAY will take on five congressional races to make campaign finance reform THE issue in those races.  And then, in 2016, MAYDAY will use those lessons and skills to elect a Congress committed to fundamental reform of this system.

# MAYDAY: the Internet has a SuperPAC 

In May, Larry Lessig and a band of volunteers launched MAYDAY, a crowdfunded, kick-started Super PAC to end all SuperPACs. The goal was to raise $1 million in small dollar donations by the end of the month.  If the goal wasn't met, donations wouldn't be kept. But the goal was surpassed in **just two weeks** and the $1 million was matched by a group of donors who, unlike most political donors, would like to see their influence decreased. 

This month, the goal is to raise $5 million (and then get that amount matched) by July 4th and declare independence from a broken system. With $12 million total in hand, MAYDAY will take on five congressional races to make campaign finance reform **THE** issue in those races. And then, in 2016, MAYDAY will take what it learns to elect a Congress committed to fundimental reform of this system.
